Analysis

Observed Trend 1: The 'Urban area' has the most drivers and riders, and fares which would suggest most rides, 
though they are at a lower cost that those seen in the 'Rural area' as it is compared dollar per distance traveled. 

Observed Trend 2: The 'Rural area' has the least riders and drivers, however, the total fares percentage is around 6.7% 
more than the expected proportion (ACTUAL riders =5.3%, PROJECTED riders=3.1%). This indicates that the demand for drivers
is hitherto higher and may cause riders to dispense more money on rides in the 'Rural area' per trip as compared to the average distance and cost of a ride in the urban environment.
Therefore we may safely infer that distance is another factor that causes a higher fee per ride.The scatter plot also 
supports the inference made from the data analyzed.

Observed Trend 3: Although 'Urban area' has the most riders and drivers, and the average fares are rather low. 
This could be due to a surplus of drivers (77.85% driver > 68.4% riders from pie chart) as demonstrated by the data
or additionally the data supports markedly shorter distances per ride.
